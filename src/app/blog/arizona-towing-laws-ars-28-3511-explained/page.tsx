                  If you own or manage private property in Arizona, understanding
                  ARS 28-3511 is essential. This statute governs when and how
                  vehicles can be towed from private property, what signage is
                  required, and what rights vehicle owners retain throughout the
                  process. Whether you manage an apartment complex, HOA community,
                  or commercial lot in the Phoenix metro area, this guide breaks
                  down the law in straightforward, easy-to-understand language.

                  What Is ARS 28-3511?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4 reveal">
                  Arizona Revised Statute 28-3511 is the primary law that governs
                  the towing and removal of vehicles from private property in the
                  state of Arizona. It establishes the legal framework that
                  property owners, towing companies, and vehicle owners must follow
                  when a vehicle is parked without authorization on private land.
                  The statute is part of Title 28 (Transportation) of the Arizona
                  Revised Statutes and falls under Chapter 10, which deals with
                  vehicle impoundment.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4 reveal">
                  In practical terms, ARS 28-3511 answers three critical
                  questions: When can a property owner have a vehicle towed? What
                  steps must be taken before and after the tow? And what
                  protections does the vehicle owner have? Understanding these
                  answers is essential for any property owner who wants to enforce
                  parking rules legally and avoid costly disputes.

                  When Can You Legally Tow a Vehicle from Private Property?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4 reveal">
                  Under ARS 28-3511, a property owner or authorized agent may
                  have a vehicle removed from private property when the vehicle is
                  parked without the owner&apos;s or property manager&apos;s
                  consent. However, the law imposes specific conditions that must
                  be met before a tow can legally occur. These conditions are
                  designed to balance the property owner&apos;s right to control
                  their land with the vehicle owner&apos;s right to fair notice.

                  face liability. ARS 28-3511 sets specific requirements for what

                  How ARS 28-3511 Connects to Other Arizona Towing Statutes
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4 reveal">
                  ARS 28-3511 does not exist in isolation. Several other Arizona
                  statutes work alongside it to create the full legal framework for
                  towing in the state. ARS 28-3511 works in conjunction with ARS
                  28-4141 through 28-4145, which govern abandoned vehicles and
                  establish the process for claiming a lien on unclaimed vehicles.
                  Additionally, ARS 28-874 addresses parking violations related to
                  fire lanes and accessible spaces, and Phoenix City Code SEC
                  36-144 adds local requirements specific to the Phoenix metro
                  area.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4 reveal">
                  For property owners, the takeaway is clear: legal compliance
                  requires understanding not just ARS 28-3511 but the broader
                  network of statutes that govern towing, impound, and vehicle
                  removal in Arizona. Working with an experienced, licensed towing
                  partner ensures that every step of the process meets all
                  applicable legal requirements.
